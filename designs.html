                    ⟡ A typography based assignment, creating visual merchandising based on a song. I created an album cover, a promotional social media banner, and designs to print on vinyl records. <br> ⟡ In response to the song I selected, my designs were inspired by nostalgia, dreaminess and past summer days.
