        <p>⟡ Assignment work for FIT2092. To this day this remains one of my favourite projects! I was tasked to create a 3D space and environment using code, specifically HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
        ⟡ This assignment helped me better understand Javascript, creating functions, using random attributes and 3D rotation values. <br>
        ⟡ This encapsulates my love for art as well as the incredible flexibility of what can be done with and within code.

        <p>⟡ Assignment work for FIT2092. The prompt was to create an online catalogue of history or facts that warp the truth. I decided to make an online museum of fake animals, hybrids I created using Clip Studio Paint. <br>
        ⟡ This project features the most Javascript I had ever used at this point, and allowed for tons of experimentation, as well as including scrolling locks and progress trackers through the navigation buttons.</p>

        <p>⟡ Assignment work for CDS3001. As this was a design unit it focused much more on art and image manipulation, but I went above the required code for this assignment to match it to my standards.<br>⟡ Inspired by the scrolling text of early 2000's webpages and modern emojis.</p>

       <p>⟡ Assignment work for CDS2001. We were allowed to pick a topic to make a Design System and Brand Guideline for. <br>⟡ I chose East Asian Mythology, and used Axure RP 10 to create a prototype for my museum's app.</p>

        <p>⟡ Assignment work for CDS3001. A collection of randomised posters, with a focus on experimentation, colour and unconventional designs. <br>⟡ All posters hosted on a homepage, with three sub-themes of typography, graphic and image based posters.</p>

        <p>⟡ Assignment work for FIT1046. We got a lot of flexibility as this was one of my first projects working with HTML and CSS.<br>
        ⟡ I focused more on the aesthetic side of things as I was still working out how to integrate HTML and CSS at this point, but for a first effort I'm still happy with it!</p>
